*Wasteland.Altis* by Team Wasteland!
===================

ArmA 3 Wasteland is a harsh survival sandbox mission where 2 teams and independent players fight for survival.


The mission is not ready yet, so for now it's just a placeholder :)

This version uses some little additions and fixes by *SoftRare* (A3Wasteland forked at v0.9f)

	   - Also save money, thirstLevel and hungerLevel to iniDB.
	   - Play dead (while prone, you cannot move while faking your own death).
	   - You cannot save the player within 20 seconds of being shot or firing your gun.
	   - You cannot save the player while playing dead.
	   - Saving player and base enabled by default (you still need @iniDB mod to use the functionality)
